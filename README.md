# HeuristicAlgorithm-BinPacking

Pack available values into bins with identical capacity. For different values, try to use as little bins as possible. 

Step:
1. run binpacking.sql in MySQL environment
2. run BinpackingDev.py

Note: 
binpacking.py contains the binpack function, which is already imported in BinpackingDev.py
